# python-embed-fix

Since Python 3.5, [an embedded version](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#the-embeddable-package) in a zip file has been provided along with other distributions.

However, the docs and usages are ambiguous, making this nice portable version hard to use.

Some people have done awesome efforts to improve that. This project goes one step further.

Based on [jtmoon79/PythonEmbed4Win](https://github.com/jtmoon79/PythonEmbed4Win), this project fix the original version and packed them, providing an out-of-the-box experience.

## Usage

Download and unzip from [Releases](https://github.com/KumaTea/python-embed-fix/releases).

Run `python.exe`.

An latest version will be on [https://github.com/KumaTea/python-embed-fix/releases/latest/download/python-latest-embed-fix-amd64.zip].

## Others

Since Python 3.9, another version packed with pip is also available.

Previous versions of Python are currently not provided due to deprecated built-in ssl libraries.
